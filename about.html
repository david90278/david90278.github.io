<article>
<p id="about-me">This website provides an overview of my work along with some personal opinions on topics 
that interest me. I am married and am a father to two children. I've worked primarily in 
Digital Marketing and E-Commerce since 2006 and started to learn to code in 2017.
</p>
Regarding Digital Marketing I have a very strong grasp of lifecycle marketing in the E-commerce space,
primarily Email and SMS marketing. I have worked with brands like Toms, American Giant, Windsor Fashions, 
Sportsman's Warehouse, Doc Martens, Charming Charlie and Trish McEvoy. For coding, I have been learning 
JavaScript, Python, Ruby and Swift UI. 

<p>I am really interested in coding as an educational tool and much of my dev work for personal
projects is geared towards helping my kids become comfortable with coding. I feel like there
is a great opportunity for school-aged children to use their innate creativity to create with 
computers the same way they create with crayons or legos. Our local <a href="https://coderdojo.org/">Coder Dojo </a> doesa great 
job getting local kids familiar with coding by using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. 
</p>
<p>I grew up in Michigan and moved to Chicago after college. I finally left the midwest in 2011 
and now reside in the Los Angeles area. I've been an avid runner for my entire adult life and 
I consider it a good day if I can get in a run - typically anywhere from 4 - 6.5 miles tends to 
work out really well for me. You can follow me <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/57006123">on Strava.</a></p>
