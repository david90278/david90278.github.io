    <article>
    <p>I have spent my entire career helping companies with their Digital Marketing campaigns. I have
        worked with large companies like Viacom and NetSuite as well as small companies with a few 
        employees. I am strongest at Email Marketing as I have been a Digital Marketing Strategist
        over the past 5 years. 
    </p>
    <p>Prior to working as a Digital Marketing Strategist I worked for 5 years in E-Commerce Operations, working
        for a small mom and pop business in Chicago. It provided me with a good understanding of all
        aspects of running a B2C retail website. The company was also one of the first third party 
        businesses to sell directly on Amazon. 
    </p>
    <p>At the very start of my career I worked for a very small division of Viacom that managed online 
        dating programs for radio stations across the country. I was primarily involved with Account
        Management and also assisted with implementing marketing campaigns that ran on the airwaves.
